<p><h2>Description</h2></p>
<p>The spices may seem like a strange combination, but this is a wonderful, delicate </p> <p>traditional Turkish dish with a twist. Serve chilled, as is traditional, or warm, as </p> <p>desired. Squeeze fresh lemon juice over dolmas before serving.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
	<li>2 onions, minced</li>
	<li>1 ½ cups uncooked white rice</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons dried currants</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>1 (8 ounce) jar grape leaves, drained and rinsed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li><p>Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.</p> <p>Saute onions until tender. Stir in rice and hot water to cover.</p> <p>Cover and simmer until rice is half cooked, about 10 minutes.</p></li>
	<li><p>Remove from heat and stir in tomato paste, currants, pine nuts,</p> <p>cinnamon, mint leaves, dill weed, allspice and cumin. Let mixture cool.</p></li>
	<li><p>Prepare a large pot by placing an inverted plate on the bottom;</p> <p>this protects the dolmas from direct heat when steaming.</p></li>
	<li><p>Rinse grape leaves in warm water; drain and cut off any stems. Place about 1 </p><p>teaspoon of the cooled rice mixture in the center of a leaf. Fold in the sides and then</p> <p>roll into a cigar shape. Place in prepared pot. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</p></li>
	<li><p>Pour in just enough warm water to reach the bottom of the first layer of dolmas.</p> <p>Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, or until rice is totally cooked.</p> <p>Check the water level often and add more as necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
